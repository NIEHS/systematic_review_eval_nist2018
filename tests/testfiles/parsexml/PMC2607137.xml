  <Text>MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal Care and Husbandry
Twenty mature (8&#8211;10 wk old) male C57BL/6 &#215; CBA F1 hybrid mice (Jackson Laboratory) were exposed to MTS (Yauk et al., 2007) using a smoke exposure system (Simani et al., 1974) adapted for mice (Hautamaki et al., 1997). Briefly, mice in individual exposure chambers were exposed to 2 cigarettes daily (1R3 reference cigarettes; Tobacco and Health Research Institute, University of Kentucky) at a rate of 0.08 L/min, 1 (20-ml) puff per 52 s, 5 days/wk for a total of 6 wk or 12 wk, including the 2-wk lead-up period (Yauk et al., 2007). Control mice were placed in restrainers only. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by exsanguation. Animal procedures were carried out under the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and procedures approved by the McMaster University Animal Research Ethics Board.
Tissue Processing
Whole hearts were excised from the mice, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C. At the time of experiment, frozen heart tissue was sliced randomly into two (upper and lower) halves. The upper half was used for RNA extraction. The lower half was further divided in two sections randomly for total protein extracts and microsome preparation.
RNA Extraction and Purification
Frozen heart tissue was sliced as described earlier. Total RNA was isolated from the upper portion of the heart tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). All RNA samples showed A260/280 ratios between 2.0 and 2.1. RNA integrity was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and only high-quality RNA (28S/18S &gt; 1.8) was used for further analysis.
Microarray Hybridization
Individual total (2.5 &#956;g) RNA samples of heart tissue from 40 mice (5 mice for each group, 4 treatment groups and 4 control groups) and universal reference total RNA (Stratagene) were used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA and cyanine-labeled cRNA (samples with Cyanine 5-CTP, and reference RNA with Cyanine 3-CTP, Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent linear amplification kits, Agilent Technologies). Cyanine-labeled cRNA targets were in vitro transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase and purified by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Five micrograms of each labeled cRNA was hybridized to Agilent 4121A oligonucleotide microarrays (Agilent Technologies) at 60&#176;C overnight. Arrays were washed and scanned on a ScanArray Express (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences), and data were acquired with ImaGene 5.5 (BioDiscovery).
Statistical Analysis of Microarray Data
A balanced blocked factorial design (Montgomery, 2001) using the date of hybridization and the date of exposure (Kerr, 2003) was used to analyze the heart data. The data were normalized using a lowess curve (Yang et al., 2002) using the SAS/STAT software, Version 8.2 of the SAS System for Windows (1999&#8211;2001, SAS Institute, Inc.). Ratio intensity plots and heat maps for the raw and normalized data were constructed using R (R Development Core Team, 2005).
Differentially expressed genes between the control and treated groups within time points were determined using the MAANOVA library (Wu et al., 2003) in R. The main effects in the model included treatment, duration of exposure, and break period, as well as all two-way interactions and the three-way interaction. This model was applied to the log2 of the relative intensities. The Fs statistic (Cui et al., 2005), a shrinkage estimator for the gene-specific variance components, was used to test main effects, interactions, and pairwise comparisons. The p values for all the statistical tests were estimated using the permutation method using residual shuffling. These p values were then adjusted for multiple comparisons by using the false discovery rate (FDR) approach (Benjamini, 1995).
The group means for the fold change calculation were based on the adjusted relative intensity for each gene where the estimated day of hybridization and date of exposure effects using parameter estimates from the analysis of variance (ANOVA) model were subtracted from the normalized ratio.
Real-Time Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Primers were designed using Beacon design 2.0 (Premier BioSoft International). About 2.5 &#956;g of total RNA per sample was reverse transcribed and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in duplicate with an iCycler IQ real-time detection system (Bio-Rad) as described in Dong et al. (2005). The values of the threshold cycle were averaged. Gene expression levels were normalized to the ubiquitin gene. PCR efficiency was examined using the standard curve for each gene. Primer specificity was assured by the melting curve for each gene. A t-test was used for statistical evaluation. Primer pairs used were: PAI-1 forward 5&#8242;CCCACACAGCCCATCAGG 3&#8242;, PAI-1 reverse 5&#8242; CCGAGGACACGCCATAGG 3&#8242;, Ubc forward 5&#8242;ACCTTCCTCACCACAGTATC 3&#8242;, Ubc reverse 5&#8242;CCATCACACCCAAGAACAAG 3&#8242;, Cyr61 forward 5&#8242;GTTCCGATGCGAAGATGG 3&#8242;, Cyr61 reverse 5&#8242;CTTGTGGATGTCATTGAATAGG 3&#8242; Cyp1A1 forward 5&#8242;ATTCCTGTCCTCCGTTACC 3&#8242;, Cyp1A1 reverse 5&#8242;AGGCTGTCTGTGATGTCC 3&#8242;.
Preparation of Microsomes
A section of the heart was taken from five individual mice (n = 5/treatment group). These heart sections were pooled into one sample. Approximately 1.0 g heart was homogenized in 2.5 ml ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 0.05 M Tris and 1.15% KCl, pH 7.4, using an ice-cold grinding vessel (size C, Thomas Scientific). The heart homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 &#215; g (9000 rpm) for 20 min at 4&#176;C. Supernatant was then centrifuged 176,000 &#215; g (44,000 rpm) for 1 h (rotor Ty 70.1, Beckman Ultracentrifuge). The supernatant was decanted, and 0.25 M sucrose was added to the microsomal pellet. The pellet was dispersed by brief sonication and was quantified for total protein content using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).
Preparation of Tissue Protein Extracts and Western Blotting
A portion of the frozen heart was homogenized in lysis buffer (5 M HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 M EGTA, 1 M MgCl2, 0.5 M NaF, 0.2 M sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets [Roche Applied Science]), centrifuged, and the supernatant was quantified for protein content using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Approximately 200 &#956;g of total protein was extracted from each individual mouse (n = 5/treatment group) from one treatment group, and subsequently pooled to make one sample. The protein content of each pooled sample was quantified again using a Bradford protein assay kit.
For Western blotting, 30 &#956;g total protein (pooled) or 50 &#956;g microsomal extract was immunoblotted on 8&#8211;12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and analyzed using antibodies against PAI-1, Cyp1A1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and tPA (American Diagnostica). Signals were detected by ECL Plus (GE Health Sciences).
Total PAI-1 Antigen and Activity Assay
Murine total PAI-1 antigen and activity assay kits (Innovation Research, Inc.) were used to analyze total and active PAI-1 protein present in heart tissue extracts. All incubations were carried out at room temperature for 30 min with agitation at 300 rpm. Fifty micrograms of pooled protein extracts for total and 100 &#956;g for active PAI-1 determination in triplicates along with known amounts of PAI-1 standards in duplicates were assayed on a 96-well plate coated with capture antibody or urokinase, respectively. Unbound PAI-1 was washed and the plate was reacted first with anti PAI-1 primary antibody followed by horseradish secondary antibody. Wells were then reacted with TMB substrate solution for 7 min and reactions were quenched with the addition of 1 N H2SO4. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm on a microtiter plate spectrophotometer.
Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) Activity Assay
Mouse tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity assay kit (Innovation Research, Inc.) was used to quantify the active mouse tPA in the tissue extracts of heart. All the reactions were carried out at ambient temperature on a shaker at 300 rpm for 30 min. In brief, 96-well immulon strip plates coated with Avidin were reacted with biotinylated human PAI-1. A series of known concentrations of tPA activity standards in duplicates and 100 &#956;g pooled total protein extracts in triplicates were added to the wells. Wells were incubated with primary anti murine-tPA antibody, horseradish peroxidase conjugate secondary antibody, and finally with TMB substrate. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 N H2SO4. Final absorbance was read at 450 nm 5 min after the addition of H2SO4.
